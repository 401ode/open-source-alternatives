Below is a collaborative list of open-source alternatives to many popular enterprise and government software needs. The list was originally adapted from the [Open Source Procurement Toolkit](https://update.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/open-source-procurement-toolkit), and has been converted from PDF to HTML ([Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)) and templated in [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

Additions? Corrections? Improvements? Please feel free to [fork this page on Github](https://github.com/benbalter/open-source-alternatives) and collaboratively edit the content.
